IceDT is an open-source method in developement intending to improve accurate automatic iceberg detection. The method applies an alternative machine-learning architecture focused on superpixel segmentation, deep learning, and ensemble learning with application to high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.

**Demonstration**. Using Radarsar RAMP AMM-1 1997 input data.

Notice:
- This is a trial and development version. Full version including graphical interface and full functionality will be made available soon.
- So far supports reading SAR files in format raster.
- code is fully implemented in Python 3.x

Requeriments:

- Python 3.x
- The land mask, coastline and ice shelves vectors used for plotting are extracted from datasets provided on-line.
