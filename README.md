# IceDT - Machine Learning approach for automatic iceberg detection from SAR imagery.

Author: Barbat, M. M.
Version 2021.1

IceDT is a framework in developement intending to improve accurate automatic iceberg detection. The framework includes an alternative machine-learning architecture focused on superpixel segmentation, deep learning, and ensemble learning with application to high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.

Pre-processing, segmentation and classification stages are optimized intending to operate under ambiguous scenarios where sea ice, ice mélange, waves, and other artefacts common in polar environments pose major obstacles for autonomous iceberg detections.

Notice:
- So far supports reading SAR files in format raster.
- code is fully implemented in Python 3.x

Requeriments:

- Python 3.x
- The land mask, coastline and ice shelves vectors used for plotting are extracted from datasets provided on-line.
